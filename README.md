Track transactions following double-entry accounting conventions.

No frameworks. No database. No libraries. No templates. No buzzwords.

Edit data files `secret_accountdata.js` and `secret_transactiondata.js`, following the examples of `accountdata.js` and `transactiondata.js`.

Account names listed on the tree and transactions table are clickable, to limit the listed transactions to only its own and children's.

Entering word(s) in "Desc:" limits transactions to those matching the description.

Dates must be formatted as D/M/YY. Clicking on the label "Start date:" resets it to the beginning of the current month.
